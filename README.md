CS170 Spring 2020 Project

## From the starter code: 
Take a look at the project spec before you get started!

Requirements:

You'll only need to install networkx to work with the starter code. For installation instructions, follow: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: where you should be writing your code to solve inputs
- `utils.py`: contains functions to compute cost and validate NetworkX graphs

When writing inputs/outputs:
- Make sure you use the functions `write_input_file` and `write_output_file` provided
- Run the functions `read_input_file` and `read_output_file` to validate your files before submitting!
  - These are the functions run by the autograder to validate submissions

## Submission Workflow
Run: python prepare_submission.py outputs/ submission.json
- The autograder looks for the file submission.json, so make sure you donâ€™t change the last input to this script.

Submit team.txt and submission.json to the Gradescope autograder
